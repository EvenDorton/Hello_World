# hello-world

Hi Humans

Ricardo here,I'm learning how to work at the coding of Android.
Last day,I almost didn't know how to use the GitHub,neither now.
I regret that I didn't study hard at English,forgive my poor English.

Waiting for Anna.

Finally,I know how to sync the code from GitHub,I understand ssh git clone sudo apt repo tsinghua key hide ...
I feel good,it's really not bad.
Just so so.

Pushing the file to the GitHub is really not easy for me,ORZ.
Boss is coming,I think I have to close the VMware,tired but happy.
